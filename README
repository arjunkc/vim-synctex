# Package

Contains a `ftplugin/tex.vim` that has tex forward search. 
Works well with LatexBox for me.

Also contains a gvim wrapper script. The wrapper script does tex reverse search.
It opens the tex file, if already open, in the correct gvim instance. This is useful
if you run many gvim instances.

This uses the default LaTeX-Box and latexsuite mapping sync mappings

    <Leader>ls

which usually corresponds to `\ls` to do tex forward search in a pdf. To do reverse search
you simply Ctrl-Click or Shift-Click on your pdf reader. I've tested it with zathura, evince
and okular. 

# Installation

## vim plugin installation
Copy `gvim-open` to your global path. `$HOME/bin/` should be in your path in most linux distributions. The It should find the gvim executable automatically, but if it fails, simply edit the file and change the GVIM environment variable like so

    GVIM=/usr/bin/gvim

### Pathogen

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone <this url>

### Vundle

## viewer setup

### Zathura
For zathura, edit `~/.config/zathura/zathurarc` and add the following line

    set synctex-editor-command 'gvim-open --remote +%{line} %{input}'

if your $PATH is setup correctly, this should work.

### Okular
In okular, go to Settings > Editor > Custom Editor and add the line

   gvim-open --remote +%l %f
